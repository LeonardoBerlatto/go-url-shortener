# Best Practices

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Be mindful about SOLID principles
- Apply Design Patterns when **needed** (strategy, builder, factory, options)
- Use good naming patterns for modules, variables and functions
- Keep business logic to the domain classes when possible (rich domain)
